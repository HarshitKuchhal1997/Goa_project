                    Compared to Calangute, Baga is quieter and also more isolated. The creek, the Retreat House perched
                    on the hill, and fewer tourists, all contribute to its unique beauty.

                    Calangute is the most popular beach with thousands thronging it in both the peak and off-season. The
                    waves rise high above as you wash away your city blues, though swimmer need to be a trifle cautious
                    because of the sudden drop and the rising waves.
